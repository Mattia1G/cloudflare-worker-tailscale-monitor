## Introduction

Tailscale is a mesh VPN that simplifies secure access to your devices. However, keeping track of device status can be challenging. This project aims to solve that problem by monitoring Tailscale devices and sending real-time notifications to your Telegram account.

## Features

- Monitor Tailscale device status in real-time.
- Send notifications to Telegram on device status changes.
- Lightweight and efficient, running on Cloudflare Workers.
- Easy to set up and configure.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Cloudflare Worker Tailscale Monitor, you will need a few prerequisites:

1. A Tailscale account.
2. A Telegram account and a bot token.
3. A Cloudflare account to deploy the worker.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (for local development)
- Cloudflare Workers CLI (Wrangler)

## Configuration

Once you have downloaded and installed the necessary files, you will need to configure the application. Open the configuration file and set the following parameters:

- **Tailscale API Key**: Obtain this from your Tailscale account.
- **Telegram Bot Token**: Create a new bot via [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram.
- **Chat ID**: You can find this by sending a message to your bot and checking the updates.
